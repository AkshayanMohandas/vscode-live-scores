## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### ⚠️ API Keys Required

**Important**: The extension can be installed and will run without API keys, but **you need at least one API key to see actual scores**.

- **With Football API key only**: You'll see football scores
- **With Cricket API key only**: You'll see cricket scores  
- **With both API keys**: You'll see both football and cricket scores

**You need at least one API key to get started!** Both APIs offer free tiers, so getting started is quick and easy.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need API keys to use this extension?

**Short answer**: The extension will install and run without API keys, but **you need at least one API key to see actual scores**.

**Detailed answer**:
- ✅ **Extension installation**: Works without API keys
- ✅ **Extension functionality**: Extension runs without crashing
- ❌ **Showing scores**: Requires at least one API key (football OR cricket)
- ⚠️ **Without API keys**: You'll see empty states and warnings like "Set footballLiveScores.apiKey" or "No live matches"

**To see scores, you need**:
- Football API key → See football scores
- Cricket API key → See cricket scores
- Both API keys → See both sports

Both APIs offer **free tiers**, so getting started is quick and easy!

### Can I use the extension with only one API key?

Yes! You can use the extension with just a football API key or just a cricket API key. The extension will show scores for whichever sport(s) you have configured. If you only have a football API key, the cricket tab will show an empty state, and vice versa.

### What happens if I don't configure any API keys?

The extension will:
- ✅ Install successfully
- ✅ Show the status bar item
- ✅ Open the dashboard when clicked
- ⚠️ Display warnings in the status bar ("Set footballLiveScores.apiKey")
- ⚠️ Show empty states in the dashboard tabs
- ❌ Not fetch or display any scores

### Are the API keys free?

Yes! Both APIs offer free tiers:
- **football-data.org**: Free tier available (registration required)
- **cricketdata.org**: Free tier available (registration required)

Check their respective websites for current free tier limits and features.

### Do I need to add API keys to the project code?

**No!** You configure API keys through VS Code Settings, not in the project code. The extension reads API keys from VS Code's configuration system, which stores them securely in your user settings. You never need to modify the extension's source code.
